- There are Notes of General Physics I&II and QISE,and others course.
- Main Contents of Note are the results of thoughts to Physical Problem of mine,without intellectual property infringement maybe
- Here are Supervisers，they are not contribute to such project directly
   - General Physics I Supervised by __Gentaro Watanabe__ gentaro@zju.edu.cn
   - General Physics II Supervised by __Wan Xin__ xinwan@zju.edu.cn, __LIM LIH KING__ lihking@zju.edu.cn
   - QISE Supervised by __Wan Xin__ xinwan@zju.edu.cn, and stuff of __Alibaba DAMO__

# FILEs
1. QuantumMachanics
- PDFs inside are notes of base laws of Non-relative Quantum Machanics,collected from Internet.
- My deduction dates back from Newton Machanics，to Analysis Machanics of Lagrange and Hamilton，then you would find out a nature transfermation from Classical Machanics to Quantum.
- Also,Field Analysis is contained.
